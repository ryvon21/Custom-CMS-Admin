# Custom-CMS-Admin
This is a custom CMS Admin (dashboard and editing pages) that I built using PHP, SQL, JQuery, HTML and CSS.
Features include a log of visitor data, unique visitor count, an animated sidebar, CRUD elements and a 'review' page with animated star icons for setting a 'rate' value that stores to the database.
This was designed as an admin page for a dynamic CMS driven movie review website.
